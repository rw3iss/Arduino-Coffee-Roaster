** I'd make this 5 stars if they just included a card with the right lib info. After hours of fussing and failures, I figured this out:
- Get the correct library from Github. I can't put in links, but search for TFT_HX8357 by Bodmer: https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_HX8357
--Download it by clicking "Code" button and choosing download as zip.
- Unzip the files, and then navigate into the unzipped folder.
- Edit the User_Setup.h file and set the driver to ILI9486 by uncommenting that line and commenting the other options.
- Zip the files back up (effectively re-rooting the zip so the files are at the top level)
- Open a blank Arduino sketch
- Open menu Sketch -> Include Library -> Add ZIP library
- Add your re-made zip.
Once these steps are done the lib is ready and the working examples are in the File -> Examples -> TFT_HX8357 menu.

** Those using the UTFT library from RinkyDink Electronics may have two issues. First, just a blank screen. If you get past that, a mirrored display. To fix those two issues:
1. Change the Arduino sketch line to: UTFT myGLCD(ILI9486,38,39,40,41);
2. Open the \UTFT\tft_drivers\ili9486\initlcd.h file. Go to the section for Memory Access Control (lines 85-86 in my version). Change the write data line to: LCD_Write_DATA(0x08);
Bit 0 of this value controls vertical flip. Bit 1 is for horizontal flip.
